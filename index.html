      <p>The Fellowship program is designed for ambitious people to concentrate on a particular area for the duration of the ~3-6 month experience, providing an invitation for interdisciplinary mid-career creatives and intellectuals to anchor in progress, and gain new skills and perspectives.  Fellows apply and Fluyt selects cohorts to stimulate serendipitous collaborations and multidisciplinary interaction.</p>

     <h3 class="responsive-h3 caps">Guests</h3>
      <p>The short-term stays makes Fluyt an attractive alternative to a hotel allowing for thought leaders to land in an active community and feel the pulse of Amsterdam for their short-duration stay.  Guests can lead lectures or salons for events and be part of the on-going community tapping into the global membership of the Embassy Network.  Partnering with other innovative housing communities in Amsterdam and other innovative, community building efforts can use Fluyt as an overflow or housing layer to their programs.</p>

     <h3 class="responsive-h3 caps mb1">Community</h3>
      <p>People are the heart of community in addition to easy opportunities to contribute and collaborate.  Short-term and Medium-term guest programs are core and Fluyt will help locally to connect Marineterrein initiatives together. Partnering with other innovative housing communities in Amsterdam and other innovative, community building efforts can use Fluyt as an overflow or housing layer to their programs.  Events are core to building community and we’ll host, as well as salons (open discussions), lectures, meet-ups and activities, to create a center of gravity for ambitious thinking, and a place where global experts seek to share their work. We envision professionals from all stages of their careers, attracting global thought leaders and Dutch changemakers meeting across interdisciplinary divides, in the same way that Ministry staff might have met at the All Ranks bar while Building 25 operated under the Marines. In fact, we will transform the main floor into a public space, called “All Ranks Lounge”, as a multi-use location.</p>

      <p>Amsterdam is a global nexus of sustainability, entrepreneurship and quality of life and transforming Building 25 into a hub of activity for Amsterdam on the pulse of global trends and the Amsterdam innovation community. With Amsterdam as a gateway into Europe, the Fluyt can serve as the perfect location for the global nomad to land and intentionally create their image of the future. Fluyt’s collaborative approach and program of events will help the residents of Amsterdam build a deeper connection with international communities, and bring the Marineterrein to life as a destination in the heart of the city.</p>

      <p>Embassy Network is a global network of mixed-use coliving communities, connected through collaboration, fluid access and mutualization of resources. Each location is locally managed and operated and aims to create an operational framework and a unique offering harnessing the pulse of its city. Together, these spaces form a global housing layer for a new world that emphasizes and explores openness, commoning, and co-creation. Our goal is to make it easier for ambitious people to access affordable, inspiring and collaborative living environments anywhere in the world, to use housing in service of greater aims, and to amplify their impact through connection to other networks. </p>
