      <p>The residency program is designed for ambitious people to concentrate on a particular area for the duration of the ~3-6 month experience, providing an invitation for interdisciplinary mid-career creatives and intellectuals to anchor in progress, and gain new skills and perspectives. </p>

     <h3 class="responsive-h3 caps">Guests</h3>
      <p>The short-term stays makes Fluyt an attractive alternative to a hotel allowing for thought leaders to land in an active community and feel the pulse of Amsterdam for their short-duration stay.  Short-term guest stays maintain a continual influx of people, ideas and perspectives.  Guests may lead lectures or salons, and be part of the ongoing community.</p>

     <h3 class="responsive-h3 caps mb1">Community</h3>
      <p>People are the heart of every community. We will support residents’ aspirational goals through coordinating visits from experts and provocateurs at various stages of each cohort, creating a center of gravity for ambitious thinking, and a place where global experts seek to share their work. We envision professionals from all stages of their careers, attracting global thought leaders and Dutch changemakers meeting across interdisciplinary divides, in the same way that Ministry staff may have met at the All Ranks bar while Building 25 operated under the Marines.</p>

      <p>The idea of the “port” is an overarching theme for the Fluyt project, representative of what we hope to create: people with like-minded interests and skills meeting one another, forging connections amongst themselves, while simultaneously representing connections between Amsterdam, San Francisco, Berlin, and other world innovation stages. </p>

      <p>Embassy Network is a global network of mixed-use coliving communities, connected through collaboration, fluid access and mutualization of resources. Each location is locally managed and operated and aims to create an operational framework and a unique offering harnessing the pulse of its city. Together, these spaces form a global housing layer for a new world that emphasizes and explores openness, commoning, and co-creation. Our goal is to make it easier for ambitious people to access affordable, inspiring and collaborative living environments anywhere in the world, to use housing in service of greater aims, and to amplify their impact through connection to other networks. </p>
