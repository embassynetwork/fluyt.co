        <p>As a freelance <strong>web and mobile developer</strong>, I love  to  be  involved  with the development process from  the very  beginning:  turning ideas into  functional prototypes  and prototypes  into  full-fledged  apps. Alternatively,  I can be  brought in  to  debug and further develop existing  apps.</p>

        <p>My go-to languages and frameworks include <strong>Objective C / Swift / iOS</strong> (I have multiple apps in the Appstore), <strong>Javascript / React.js and Python / Flask</strong>. In the past, I have built open source plugins for <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse">Discourse</a> in Ruby / Rails / Ember.js.</p>

        <p>When  Iâ€™m not busy  building apps, you can  probably  find  me  playing around with new programming languages, learning more <strong>functional programming</strong> and <strong>digital security</strong>, or organizing events as a <strong>director of <a href="http://womenwhocode.com" target="_blank">Women Who Code Berlin.</a></strong></p>
